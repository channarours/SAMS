The reason that push our team to develop SAMS’s application because scraping or web scraping technology is still limited to developers, especially in Cambodia. Also, we hope that the application will be the guideline or the experiment for young developer whom want to take path or study in the fields. Importantly, working on SAMS, we have learn and understand about our lacking resource in scraping technology which the field really is popular in Japan or Korean. And, we’ve predicted that in the future the field will be necessary in Cambodia based on the growing micro finances or banks. That is the golden chance for the developers. Also, learning the new technology is really interesting to strengthen our knowledge as a programmer.
